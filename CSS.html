    <p>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a styling language used to control the presentation and visual aesthetics of web pages. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS is responsible for how that content looks â€“ everything from colors, fonts, and spacing to complex layouts, animations, and responsive design for different screen sizes. By separating style from structure, CSS makes web development more efficient and maintainable, allowing developers to apply consistent designs across multiple pages and easily update the look of an entire website from a single file. This separation of concerns significantly improves code organization, reduces file sizes, and enhances the overall user experience.</p>
