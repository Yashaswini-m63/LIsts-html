    <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely recognized for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) and released in 1995, Java's core principle is its platform independence, achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that Java code, once compiled into bytecode, can run on any device or operating system that has a JVM installed, without needing to be rewritten. Its robust, secure, and scalable nature has made it a popular choice for developing a vast array of applications, including enterprise-level software, Android mobile apps, large-scale web applications, cloud computing solutions, and even components for the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
