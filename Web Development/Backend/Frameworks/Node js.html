    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically for building server-side applications and command-line tools. Unlike traditional server-side languages that often create a new thread for each request, Node.js utilizes a single-threaded, event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it highly efficient and scalable, particularly for data-intensive and real-time applications like chat applications and streaming services. Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js offers exceptional performance by compiling JavaScript code directly to machine code. Its robust ecosystem, powered by the Node Package Manager (NPM), provides access to a vast collection of reusable modules, significantly accelerating development and fostering a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm where a single language can be used for both client-side and server-side development.</p>
