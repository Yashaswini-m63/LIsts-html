    <p>MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that offers a flexible, document-oriented data model, providing a significant alternative to traditional relational databases. Unlike SQL databases that store data in rigid, table-based structures, MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which are similar to JSON objects. This document-based approach allows for dynamic schemas, meaning that documents within the same collection can have different fields, making it highly adaptable to evolving data requirements. MongoDB is favored for its horizontal scalability, high performance, and rich query language, making it an excellent choice for modern applications that handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as real-time analytics, content management, and mobile applications.</p>
