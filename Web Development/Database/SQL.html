    <p>Structured Query Language, commonly known as SQL, is a powerful and standardized programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. Unlike general-purpose programming languages, SQL focuses on data operations, allowing users to efficiently create, store, retrieve, update, and delete data within tabular database structures. It serves as the primary means of communication with relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, making it an indispensable tool for database administrators, developers, and data analysts who need to interact with and extract insights from vast amounts of structured information.</p>
