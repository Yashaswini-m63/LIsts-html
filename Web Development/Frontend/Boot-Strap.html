        Bootstrap is a widely popular, free, and open-source front-end framework that significantly simplifies and accelerates the development of responsive and mobile-first websites. Created by developers at Twitter, it provides a comprehensive collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, including elements like navigation bars, buttons, forms, carousels, and a robust grid system. By offering these ready-to-use building blocks and a consistent design language, Bootstrap allows developers to quickly create visually appealing and functionally consistent web pages that automatically adapt to various screen sizes and devices, saving considerable time and effort compared to writing custom CSS and JavaScript from scratch.
