    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the fundamental language for creating all web pages you encounter online. It's a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it uses a system of "tags" to structure and define the content of a web document. These tags, tell web browsers how to display text, images, links, and other media, essentially acting as the blueprint for how information is organized on a webpage. HTML is crucial because it provides the semantic meaning and hierarchical structure that allows both humans and search engines to understand the content, forming the essential foundation upon which styling (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript) are built.</p>
