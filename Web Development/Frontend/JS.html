    <p>JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. While HTML provides the structure and CSS handles the styling, JavaScript acts as the "brain" of a website, enabling features like interactive forms, animated graphics, dynamic content updates, and much more. It runs primarily on the client-side, directly within the user's web browser, allowing for faster responses and a richer user experience without constant communication with a server. Beyond web browsers, JavaScript has expanded its reach, with technologies like Node.js allowing it to be used for server-side development, making it a full-stack language capable of powering entire web applications.</p>
